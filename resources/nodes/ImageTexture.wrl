# The ImageTexture node defines a texture map by specifying an image file and general parameters for mapping to geometry.
# The supported file formats are PNG and JPEG.
# The image dimensions (width and height) should be a power of two, e.g., 256 x 1024 pixels.
# All the geometry primitive nodes can be textured.
