To use this controller, first assign a unique DEF name for each of the robots
    that you want to control. Also set the supervisor field to TRUE.

Next, add a new Robot Node to the webots world
(Right click, Add New, Base Nodes, Robot)

Set this new Robot arguments as follows
    - DEF = "control" 
    - controller = teleport_master_controller
    - controllerArgs[0] = "control"
    - supervisor = TRUE
    
You should also add controllerArgs arguments following argument 0 such that they
    match the DEF names of the robots that you want to control with this
    particular master controller.
