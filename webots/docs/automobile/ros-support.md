## ROS Support

In order to access all the services corresponding to the functions of the [driver](driver-library.md) and [car](car-library.md) libraries, the `ros_automobile` controller should be used.

> **Note**: You will need to copy the automobile service files in your catkin workspace and add them to the "CMakeLists.txt" to be able to use them.
